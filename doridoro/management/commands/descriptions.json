    "free_time_description": "I would like to have time for a dog again. I really miss the morning walks with my dog to start the day with positive energy. My aim is to find a better balance between my life and my needs, those of my son and the demands of my future job. In the morning, I need time for myself, to find the strength and energy I need for the hole day, to concentrate and to do something good for my body. I like sitting in front of the computer, but you also need time to exercise and channel your energy. Organizing my energy in the evening does not work as well as it does in the morning.\n\nIn the evening, I like to watch films and take a break from my day. I like spending time with animals, especially dogs and horses. Some time ago, I have bought a little pony for my son and me. I love spending time with animals. This pony is so adorable and it gives me so much strength back. Once a week I am able to take riding lessens. This horse is amazing, the bond I feel to him is really fascinating.\n\nI like to talk with my family and my best friend. I really enjoy exchanging information on specific subjects, small-talk is difficult for me. I like to share my knowledge, I like to teach others and I'm a good listener. For some time now, I've been reading articles on Medium or Dev.io to refine my knowledge. I've also written articles on Dev.io."
